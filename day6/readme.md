# XGBoost: 
- a model ensembling technique
- models are trained sequentially
- models are usually decision trees
- boosting means training models sequentially 
- each upcoming model correct the error of previous one 
- XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. 
- Itâ€™s an optimized, scalable implementation of gradient boosting, a machine learning 
    technique that builds strong predictive models by combining many weak learners (usually decision trees).
